My Landing Page:

Is my 1st published on github project where I share my code with the public. The whole idea is to show my that I can create code on Visual Studio Code, 
link my update and commit changes in Git-Gui App, use Apache PHP Webserver to test the page and then upload all the files to github repisitory.



I used languages; HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap in order to showcase, and still will be updating the side on incremental basis towards its finished product.

I'm constantly learning as I go along.
